# RPG-Maker-Android-App
 This is just a quick and dirty way to enable you to convert your RPG Maker game to android.

Made with Android studio using Kotlin. So keep it there. Tested With RPG Maker MV but it certainly works with MZ. Use it by your own I do not guarantee the end-user experience.

Currently:
- It is not pretty
- Doesn't obey any stands
- Uses deprecated code
- This project doesnt implement any touch commands or anything at all

But:
- Works

How to use:
- Import this project to Android studio
- Change names and icons to fit your project
- Use some touch controls or even controller plugins in your project
- Export your game to Web
- Copy the contents of www from your exported game to app/src/main/assets/www
- Build the APK on Android Studio
- Profit

Caution:
-If you update your game your user is likely to lost their save. Not sure though.

[If you use this project please credit me somewhere in your game.
A message here to tell me you did it would be much appreciated]
